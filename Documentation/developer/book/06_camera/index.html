<h2>Using Cameras</h2>

<h4>Transforms</h4>
<h5>Coordinate Systems</h5>
<p>
Several coordinate systems are involved in taking a vertex from its local coordinate
system to a pixel position within a window. The majority of these coordinate systems
are controlled by the current camera, operating in conjunction with the geometrical
transform objects.
</p>

<p>
A vertex is initially specified in <em>local coordinates</em>. This is an arbitrary
coordinate system, chosen in a way that makes sense for the vertex's object. Typically
the origin will be placed at the center of the object, to allow it to be transformed
intuitively.
</p>

<p>
During rendering, vertices are transformed from their local coordinate system to
<em>world coordinates</em>. This coordinate system is also arbitrary, however it
establishes a common coordinate system for all objects within the world.
</p>

<p>
The camera position and orientation is typically specified in world coordinates, but
for rendering purposes a camera object also needs a coordinate system known as
<em>view coordinates</em>. This coordinate system moves the camera location to the
origin, with the camera looking down the -z axis and the camera up vector placed
along the +y axis.
</p>

<p>
Although the view coordinate system establishes the camera's overall view of the world,
a further coordinate system is necessary to establish what falls within the camera's
field of view. This coordinate system is known as <em>frustum coordinates</em>. This
provides the camera with the "lens" through which it sees the world, and allows the
camera to apply a particular type of projection (e.g., perspective or orthographic)
to the scene.
</p>

<p>
Quesa's frustum coordinate system ranges from -1 to +1 in x and y, and 0 to -1 in
z (where 0 is the near clipping plane, and -1 is the far clipping plane). Once the
scene has been transformed to this coordinate system, it then passes through the
<em>view port</em> transform. This transform selects a portion of the xy plane of
the frustum coordinate system, and it is this portion which is mapped to the draw
context for display.
</p>

<p>
Once the coordinates have passed through the view port transform, they can then be
mapped to the draw context. This is achieved with the <em>frustum to window</em>
transform. This transform takes the portion of the frustum that was selected with the
view port transform, and maps it to the active pane of the draw context being rendered
to.
</p>



<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>
Coordinates pass through five transforms to take them from local coordinates to window
coordinates:
