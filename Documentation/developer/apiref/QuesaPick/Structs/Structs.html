<p>Hit path data.
<br><br>
Returned by Q3Pick_GetPickDetailData for the kQ3PickDetailMaskPath
pick selector. Disposed of by Q3HitPath_EmptyData.
<br><br>
rootGroup holds the top level group which encloses the picked
object. positions holds an array for each nested group within
the submit sequence, indicating the position that was submitted
at each level. This array contains depth values.
<br><br>
E.g., assuming 'object' is the picked object, then submitting:
<br><br>
group1(object)
<br><br>
would produce a rootGroup field of group 1, a depth field of 1,
and positions[0] would contain the position of object within
group1.
<br><br>
Submitting:
<br><br>
group1(group2(object))
<br><br>
would produce a rootGroup field of group1, a depth field of 2,
positions[0] would hold the position of group2 within group1,
and positions[1] would hold the position of object within group2.
<br><br><br>
Note that the contents of the position array are only valid if
the submitted groups are unchanged since they were submitted
for picking.
<br><br>
If these groups have had items added or removed since they
were submitted, the positions array will no longer be valid.
