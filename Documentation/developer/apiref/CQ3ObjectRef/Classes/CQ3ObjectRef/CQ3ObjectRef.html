<H1>CQ3ObjectRef</H1><hr>
Wrapper for Quesa objects.
<br>
<p></p>
<hr><br>
The main purpose for using a C++ wrapper for a Quesa object is to
prevent memory leaks.  The wrapper's destructor disposes the object.
This class is designed to be usable in STL container classes.
It is not like std::auto_ptr, in that the copy constructor adds a
reference rather than transferring ownership.  One could base such
a wrapper on boost::intrusive_pointer, but I chose not to require
Boost.
<br><br>
Due to a HeaderDoc bug, it is not possible to automatically
document more than one constructor.  Besides the constructor from
a TQ3Object, there is a default constructor (which holds NULL)
and a copy constructor.
<br><br>
This wrapper is not fully functional with objects that are not
reference-counted (such as views and picks) because the copy
constructor calls Q3Shared_GetReference.
