<H1>CQ3ObjectRef</H1><hr>
Wrapper for Quesa objects.
<br>
<p></p>
<hr><br>
The main purpose for using a C++ wrapper for a Quesa object is to
prevent memory leaks.  The wrapper's destructor disposes the object.
This class is designed to be usable in STL container classes, in a way similar
to std::shared_ptr.  One could base such a wrapper on boost::intrusive_pointer,
but I chose not to require Boost.
<br><br>
Due to a HeaderDoc bug, it is not possible to automatically
document more than one constructor.  Besides the constructor from
a TQ3Object, there is a default constructor (which holds nullptr)
a copy constructor, and a move constructor.
<br><br>
This wrapper is not fully functional with objects that are not
reference-counted (such as Views and Picks).  Calling the copy constructor
or copy assignment operator on a CQ3ObjectRef holding an object of a non-shared
type will result in a fatal assertion failure inside Q3Shared_GetReference.
