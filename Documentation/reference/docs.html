<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
The definitive reference for the behaviour of Quesa is currently the source code.
However, this page will attempt to provide an overview of the Quesa system, and
provide some background for development.
</p>

<p>
The Quesa distribution is divided into three main folders:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>SDK
	<li>Development
	<li>Documentation
</ul>

<p>
The SDK folder contains example applications and receives the Quesa libraries
produced by builds. It also contains additional projects related to Quesa such
as the Queeg game framework, and an example file importer plug-in.
</p>

<p>
The Development folder contains the projects, makefiles, and source code required
to build Quesa.
</p>

<p>
The Documentation folder contains the documentation, which is a local copy of the
Quesa web site.
</p>



<h3>File Structure</h3>
<p>
Ignoring the SDK and Documentation directories, the third directory in the Quesa
distribution is the Development directory.
</p>

<p>
This directory contains the projects, makefiles, and all of the source code required
to build Quesa. The layout of this directory looks like:
</p>

<pre>
    Development/
        Projects/
            Be/
            Mac/
            Unix/
            Windows/
        Scripts/
        Source/
            Core/
                Geometry/
                Glue/
                Support/
                System/
                Viewer/
            Platform/
                Be/
                Mac/
                Unix/
                Windows/
            Renderers/
                Common/
                Generic/
                Interactive/
                Wireframe/
</pre>

<p>
At the top level, three directories are provided: Projects, Scripts, and Source.
</p>



<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>
The Projects directory contains the projects and makefiles required to build Quesa,
split into directories for each platform.
</p>

<p>
These projects look for source files and include files within the Development/Source
directory, and leave their output in the appropriate SDK/Libraries directory.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Unix makefile is fairly rudimentary - if you have experience of tools like
autoconf (and think using it would be a good idea), please let the mailing list
know.</i>
</p>



<h4>Scripts</h4>
<p>
The Scripts directory contains some Perl scripts used in the development of Quesa,
e.g., for updating the status table on each release, or regenerating the API reference.
</p>



<h4>Source</h4>
<p>
The Source directory is the most important directory - it contains the entire source
tree for Quesa.
</p>

<p>
The Source directory contains all of the source for all of the components of Quesa: this
builds into at least three shared libraries, all of which draw files from different
portions of the tree.
</p>

<p>
The Source directory is split into three main categories: Core, Platform, and Renderers.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Core directory contains the core source code for Quesa. Everything
		within this directory is cross platform.

	<li>The Platform directory contains platform specific code, split into further
		directories for each platform.

	<li>The Renderers directory contains the source code for Quesa's plug-in renderers.
		Everything within this directory is cross platform, and capable of being built
		as a separate shared library which can be loaded at run-time.
</ul>

The Platform and Renderers directories are fairly straightforward, however the Core
directory contains a further split which needs discussion.



<h4>Source/Core</h4>
<p>
At the lowest level, the Core directory contains five directories: Geometry, Glue, Support,
System, and Viewer.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Geometry directory contains the individual geometry classes. Each class
		is contained in a separate .c file, with a matching .h file to export the
		methods available for that class.
	
	<li>The Glue directory contains the symbols exported by the Quesa library: these
		are the entry points called by applications, and are responsible for performing
		parameter checking, system housekeeping, and forwarding the call to the
		implementation routine.<br>
		Each .c file in this directory contains the entry points for the matching
		API .h file (e.g., QD3DMath.c corresponds to QD3DMath.h).
	
	<li>The Support directory contains support code: debug routines, memory management,
		hash tables, the class tree, etc.
	
	<li>The System directory contains the bulk of Quesa - the files within this directory
		are the actual implementation routines invoked by the Glue entry points.<br>
		There is a single .c and .h file for each of the Glue .c files (e.g., E3Math.[ch]
		corresponds to QD3DMath.c).
	
	<li>The Viewer directory contains the source for the Viewer library: this is a utility
		library which sits on top of Quesa, and as such can be self-contained.
</ul>



<h3>Internal Structure</h3>
<p>
No detailed documentation or design documents exist for the internals of Quesa.
</p>

<p>
However, the main flow of control during a rendering loop can be described through
a pyramid structure as seen below.
</p>

<table align=center width=10% border=1 bordercolor=black bgcolor="#E0E0FF"><tr align=center><td>
Glue
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<table align=center width=15% border=1 bordercolor=black bgcolor="#E0FFE0"><tr align=center><td>
System
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<table align=center width=20% border=1 bordercolor=black bgcolor="#FFE0E0"><tr align=center><td>
Geometry
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<table align=center width=25% border=1 bordercolor=black bgcolor="#FFFFE0"><tr align=center><td>
Support
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<table align=center width=30% border=1 bordercolor=black bgcolor="#E0FFFF"><tr align=center><td>
Platform
</td></tr></table>

<p>
The flow of control proceeds from top to bottom, with the application invoking the Glue
level at the top of the pyramid and an image being produced with the help of the Platform
layer at the base of the pyramid.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note that this is slightly inaccurate, in that the final image is actually produced by
a renderer object, which sits outside this pyramid - however, the platform level is as good
a place as any to consider when looking for the 'base' of Quesa.</i>
</p>

<p>
In more detail, the steps are:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The Application calls an API entry point, which is implemented by a function within
		the Core/Glue area of the source tree. This function performs parameter validation,
		updates some internal structures, and forwards the call to the matching implementation
		routine.
	
	<li>This implementation routine typically lives within the Core/System area of the source
		tree, and will ultimately perform the majority of the work involved in handling the
		request.
	
	<li>A more specialised level exists below the System level, which is the geometry objects.
		These are invoked during the rendering pipeline, and produce efficient (e.g., TriMesh)
		representations of higher level geometries for a renderer.
	
	<li>The lowest level that still remains platform independent is the Core/Support level. This
		includes fundamental data structures such as the class tree (a tree-like structure which
		indicates the relationships between the various classes registered with Quesa).

	<li>Finally, the lowest level is the platform specific level. This is typically concerned
		with issues such as shared library loading, working with the platform's native windowing
		API to arrange output, and implementing platform specific storage classes.
</ol>



<h3>Classes And Objects</h3>
<p>
The terms 'class' and 'object' have been referred to above, and as such require further
explanation.
</p>

<p>
In Quesa, virtually every persistent data structure is related in some way to an <em>object</em>
(more specifically, a TQ3Object).
</p>

<p>
As in a language such as C++, <em>objects</em> are <em>instances</em> of entities called
<em>classes</em>. An object holds the particular data for an instantiation of a class,
while a class holds the data which is common to all objects of that type.
</p>

<p>
E.g., the triangle class contains methods which are used to initialise and destroy
triangle objects. This data is common to all triangle objects (and so stored in the
class), while specific instances of triangle objects carry additional data which makes
them unique (e.g., their colour).
</p>

<p>
Quesa maintains a data structure known as the class tree, which acts as a database to record
what classes are registered with the system. A tree is used since classes can, as in normal
OO programming, inherit from other classes (e.g., the TQ3SharedObject class provides reference
counting services to every class derived from it).
</p>

<p>
Modules within Quesa register their classes with the class tree when Quesa is initialised,
and provide functions to manipulate instances of that class as the application creates them.
</p>



<h4>An Example Class</h4>
<p>
To get a feel for how this fits together, you may want to study one particular class. A good
class to start with is the triangle geometry.
</p>

<p>
Examine System/Geometry/E3GeometryTriangle.c to see how the class registers itself with
the class tree, and the methods it registers with the class tree.
</p>

<p>
These methods are invoked as triangles are created, disposed of, and manipulated, so
placing breakpoints within this file will allow you to observe when and how objects
are manipulated by Quesa at runtime.
</p>

<p>
The triangle object is a good starting point since it demonstrates how a simple object
is registered and unregistered within Quesa, how the instance data of an object is
manipulated, and how instances of the class are created and destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Although some details will differ, the code to implement a triangle object is
fundamentally identical in structure to the code for all other Quesa objects.
