Welcome to Quesa for Unix


this is the source distribution for the Quesa Unix library project.
You can install it in the used manner:

Before building the library be sure you have installed in your system the X, and OpenGL headers and libraries
	(on debian they are in the 'libxt-dev','xlibmesa-gl-dev','xlibmesa-glu-dev' packages)

-Set your current working directory to the directory containing this document

		[machine:~] me% cd Quesa-1.6dxx

-And prepare the build system for your machine

		[machine:Quesa-1.6dxx] me% ./configure

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.


-Once the build system is oriented we can build the library

		[machine:Quesa-1.6dxx] me% make

-And finally let access the library from other programs (as root)

		[machine:Quesa-1.6dxx] root# make install

this will install the quesa library (libquesa.a), in /usr/local/lib, and 
the Quesa header files in /usr/local/includes/Quesa

- You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.
