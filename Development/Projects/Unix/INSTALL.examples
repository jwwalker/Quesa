Welcome to Quesa Examples for Unix

this is the source distribution for the Quesa Unix Examples.
You can install them in the used manner

first make sure you have installed the Quesa library (libquesa.a) and 
its headers in your system, (using the package quesa-1.6dxx) 

other than the requirements for the quesa library, the examples depends on GTK
 headers and libraries
	(on debian package 'libgtk1.2-dev')

		[machine:quesaexamples-1.6dxx] me% make

-And optionally let other users to access the programs 
      (this step has to be done as root)
