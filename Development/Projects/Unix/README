Welcome to Quesa

Quesa is a high level 3D graphics library, which offers binary and
source level compatibility with Apple's QuickDraw(tm) 3D API. Quesa
does not contain any Apple source code,and was developed without
access to Apple's QD3D implementation.

QD3D supports both retained and immediate mode rendering, an
extensible file format, plug-in renderers, a wide range of high level
geometries, hierarchical models, and a consistent and
object-orientated API.

Quesa acts as a scene-graph on top of lower-level APIs such as OpenGL
or Direct 3D.

Applications written to the Quesa API can take advantage of an
extensive 3D toolkit that includes file importers/exporters, plug-in
renderers, and high-level geometries, while still leveraging the
performance of low-level OpenGL 3D hardware acceleration.


Quesa is a cross-platform Open Source project, which supports Mac OS
X/9, Windows, and Linux.

Quesa comes comes with projects for CodeWarrior or Project Builder,
(that can generate Carbon, Cocoa, or Classic libraries) on Mac OS
Visual C++ and CodeWarrior for Windows, and a GNU build system
(autoconf) for Unix.

Quesa is released as Open Source under a BSD license. For more

The latest Quesa source code is also available from our CVS server,
details of which are on our web site.
