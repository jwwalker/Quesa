Welcome to Quesa for Unix

Quesa is a high level 3D graphics library,
which offers binary and source level compatibility with Apple's QuickDrawª 3D API.
Quesa does not contain any Apple source code,and was developed without access to
Apple's QD3D implementation.

QD3D supports both retained and immediate mode rendering,
an extensible file format, plug-in renderers, a wide range of high level geometries,
hierarchical models, and a consistent and object-orientated API.

Quesa acts as a scene-graph on top of lower-level APIs such as OpenGL or Direct 3D.


Applications written to the Quesa API can take advantage of an extensive
3D toolkit that includes file importers/exporters, plug-in renderers, and
high-level geometries, while still leveraging the performance of low-level
OpenGL 3D hardware acceleration.


Quesa is a cross-platform Open Source project, which supports Mac OS X/9,
Windows, and Linux.

Quesa comes comes with projects for CodeWarrior or Project Builder,
 (that can generate Carbon, Cocoa, or Classic libraries) on Mac OS
Visual C++ and CodeWarrior for Windows,
and a GNU build system (autoconf) for Unix.


Quesa is  released as Open Source under the LGPL, <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html>
