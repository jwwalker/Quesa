	@function	E3Ray3D_IntersectCone
	@abstract	Compute the intersections between a ray and a cone surface.
	@discussion	This function computes the minimum and maximum values of t
				such that inRay.origin + t * inRay.direction is in the cone.
	
				If the ray misses the cone, the function result will be false
				and the output parameters should be ignored.  if the ray origin
				is in the interior of the cone, outMinParam will be set to 0.
				It is possible that there is no largest value of t, in which
				case outMaxParam will be set to INFINITY.

	@param		inRay			A ray with a normalized direction.
	@param		inConeAxis		Axis ray of cone with a normalized direction.
	@param		inConeCosine	Cosine of angle from axis ray to surface of
								cone, in interval (0, 1).
	@param		outMinParam		Receives least parameter for which the ray is
								within the cone, not less than 0.0.
	@param		outMaxParam		Receives greatest parameter for which the ray is
								within the cone, or INFINITY.
	@result		True if the ray hits the cone.
