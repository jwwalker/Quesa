	@function	E3Ray3D_IntersectTriangle
	@abstract	Find the intersection between a ray and a triangle.
	@discussion	If the ray is in the plane of the triangle, we report no hit
				even though there may mathematically be infinitely many points
				of intersection.
				
				If we do detect a hit, then hitPoint->u and hitPoint->v are two
				barycentric coordinates of the intersection point, and
				hitPoint->w is the distance along the ray.  To be precise,
				theRay->origin + hitPoint->w * theRay->direction ==
				(1.0 - hitPoint->u - hitPoint->v) * point1 +
				hitPoint->u * point2 + hitPoint->v * point3.
	@param		theRay			A ray.
