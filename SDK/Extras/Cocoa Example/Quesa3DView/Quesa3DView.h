//===========================================================================
//	The Quesa3DViewDelegate is called upon to actually submit the application
//	specific QD3D objects to the TQ3ViewObject.
//
//	The first time through the draw loop, after the Quesa3DView is visible, the 
//	view initializes the draw context and calls qd3dViewDidInit on it's qd3dDelegate.
//	This is a good time to setup lights (default lights are created).
//
//	Each frame, qd3dViewWillRender: is called then starts the
//	Q3View rendering loop. Inside, it qd3dViewRenderFrame is called on the qd3dDelegate
//	on each pass through the frame. This is where the qd3dDelegate should submit the
//	objects to the views TQ3ViewObject.
//
//	After rendering is finished, qd3dViewDidRender is called.
//	At the moment, KeyUp and KeyDown events are also passed to the qd3dView. I'm not sure
//	if this is a good idea or not, but they seem useful there.
