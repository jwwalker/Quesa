Nor OpenGL, nor DirectX has similar feature. Rayshade for Quesa is a proof of this concept.</p>		<h2>Compiling the source:</h2>		<p>You'll need the <a href="http://www.quesa.org/">Quesa SDK</a>. The rayshade directory should be inside the SDK/Extras folder. The compiled binaries will be generated into the SDK/Extras/Rayshade/Bin folder.</p>		<h2>Code structure</h2>		<p>All source compiles as a C++ code. STL is needed for compiling some source. Rayshade for Quesa has three modules:</p>		<ul>			<li>Sources/Rayshade - Contains the slightly modified rayshade source. It has no Quesa API usage/dependece. No platform specific code.			<li>Sources/RTInterface - A generic ray tracer interface. No platform specific code. Quesa API based.			<li>Sources/QD3DPlugin - This contains glue code that transforms QD3D renderer API to RTInterface api calls. Minimal platform specific code.		</ul>		<h2>Rayshade</h2>		<p><a href="http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~cek/rayshade/rayshade.html">Rayshade</a> is an UNIX raytracer. It was choosen because it's simple, non naive implementation (see rayshade/libobj/grid.cpp), and extensible.</p>		<p>The modified sources of rayshade can be found in the rayshade directory. The following modifications done with the rayshade sources:</p>		<ul>			<li>It's source was in old K&amp;R style C code, i've converted it to ANSI C. 			<li>All files renamed to .cpp, as they compiled as a C++ code.			<li>Rayshade had a scene description language. This interpreter code has to be replaced with a procedural api. (This API is found in the RTInterface folder). This required few changes.			<li>Texture code was modified as it's comming from the memory and not from a file. (libtext/CTexture.)		</ul>		<h2>RTInterface</h2>		<p>The RTInterface is a generic interface for Quesa raytracer plugins. Note that this interface doesn't use Rayshade code/header at all. So one can implement this interface for other raytracer than Rayshade.</p>		<p>It's basic usage is:</p>		<ol>			<li>Create a scene description			<li>Set scene camera, submit objects, lights.			<li>Create a raytracer for the scene.			<li>Perform raytracing.		</ol>		<p>{</p>		<p>  <code>drawContext = RT_Create();</code></p>		<p>  <code>  RT_BeginScene(drawContext);</code></p>		<p>     <code>  /* Add objects to scene */</code></p>		<p>     <code>   RT_Add...Light (drawContext,...);</code></p>		<p>     <code>   RT_SubmitTriangle (drawContext, ...);</code></p>		<p>  <code>RT_EndScene(drawContext);</code></p>		<p>  <code>/* Do the ray tracing stuff: */</code></p>		<p>  tracer = RTRayTracer_Create (width,height);</p>		<p>  for (i = 0; i &lt; height; i++) {</p>		<p>     RTRayTracer_ScanNextLine (tracer,i,buffer,sizeof(buffer));</p>		<p>     plot(buffer); </p>		<p>  }</p>		<p>  RTRayTracer_Delete (tracer);</p>		<p>}</p>		<h4>List of files and their description:</h4>		<ul>			<li>RT_Light.h - defines api to submit light objects			<li>RT_Surface.h - defines api to create surface description/set actual surface			<li>RT_Geometry.h - defines api to submit objects. (only triangle currently)			<li>RT.h - defines api for creating/managing scene object.			<li>RT_Tracer.h - defines api for performing the raytrace of a scene.		</ul>		<p></p>		<h2>QD3DPlugin</h2>		<p>Implements the QuickDraw plugin. This code uses only Quesa headers, and RT headers. <tt>RS_Rasterize.cpp </tt>and <tt>RSPlugin.cpp</tt> contains platform specific code.</p>		<h2>ToDo:</h2>		<p>A lot of thing can be do with this plugin, here are a few ideas.</p>		<ul>			<li>Add GUI to modify renderer settings like antialiasing.			<li>Port to Cocoaa, Linux, BeOS.			<li>Improve Win32 drawing code performance. (<tt>RS_Rasterize.cpp) </tt>It's draws eachg pixel a rectangle, this might be expensive operation on Wi32 HDC.			<li>Add custom attributes for Quesa for the following Rayshade features:			<ul>				<li>Field of view				<li>Bump mapping				<li>Procedural textures				<li>Soft shadows				<li>Reflections			</ul>			<li>Implement more geometries. Rayshade can render cylinder, ellipsoid. Currently they are rendered as triangles!			<li>Fix bugs...		</ul>		<h2>Porting to other platforms:</h2>		<p>Is very easy. Hopefully you should modify the <tt>RSPlugin.cpp</tt>, and <tt>RS_Rasterize.cpp</tt> code only. (In QD3DPlugin folder.) This should be trivial. Currently they contain Win32, and MacOS specific code. For compiling the stuff you need an <a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STL</a> implementation. </p>		<h2>Contact:</h2>		<p>Altough i no longer develop this stuff.
