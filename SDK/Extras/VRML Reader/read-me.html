<title>VRML Reader Plugin for Quesa</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>About the VRML Reader</h1>

<p>This is a Quesa plug-in file format reader for the VRML file format (virtual
reality markup language), versions 1 and 2.  This makes it possible to load 3D
objects in VRML format (usually indicated by a <code>.wrl</code> extension)
into Quesa.  Not all VRML features are implemented. In
particular, VRML nodes relating to interactivity, lights, and viewpoints are
ignored.</p>

<p>Some web sites serve VRML files that have been compressed by gzip.  Such files
would have to be decompressed before being passed to the VRML reader.</p>

<p>The VRML Reader plug-in was created by James W. Walker, but may have been
improved later by other Quesa developers.</p>

<h1>License</h1>

<p>Like Quesa itself, the plug-in is free and open source with a BSD-style

<h1>Compiling Sources</h1>

<p>The source code for the plug-in is available by <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=45158">CVS</a> along with the rest
of the Quesa source.  At this writing, the plugin source code comes with a
project file for the CodeWarrior 9 IDE, suitable for building binaries for
Macintosh and Windows, and a project file for the Xcode 2.1 IDE, suitable for
building binaries for Mac OS X.  If you must support another platform or use another
compiler, here are some important points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The plug-in requires a recent version of the <a
href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> sources.  You will need to set up access
paths so that Boost headers can be found.  Be warned that Boost 1.33.0 has a
serious bug in its shared_ptr code, which is fixed in current Boost CVS sources.</li>

<li>The plug-in uses the Spirit parser library within Boost.  This makes heavy
use of template metaprogramming, so you will need a C++ compiler that supports
the standards fairly well.</li>

<li>None of the functions in the plug-in need to be exported, but you must
arrange for the appropriate function in the <code>main.cp</code> file to be
called when the plug-in is loaded.</li>

<li>The way Quesa recognizes plug-ins is platform-dependent:
	<ul>
		<li>On Windows, a plug-in is a DLL with the extension
		<code>.xq3</code>.</li>
		
		<li>On Macintosh, when using the CFM binary format (usually used for
		older programs that support OS 9), a plug-in is a shared library with
		the HFS file type 'shlb' and creator code 'Q3XT'.</li>
		
		<li>On Macintosh, when using the Mach-O binary format, a plug-in is a
		bundle package with the extension "<code>.quesaplug</code>".</li>
	</ul> </li>
</ul>

<h1>Installing Binaries</h1>

<p>Plug-in binaries can be loaded by Quesa in several locations, which depend
upon the platform.</p>

<h2>Mac OS X, CFM format</h2>

<p>Quesa plug-ins can be found in the following locations.  These locations may
not all be distinct.</p>

<ul>

<li>The folder containing Quesa</li>
<li>The folder containing the application</li>
<li>/Library/CFMSupport</li>
<li>~/Library/CFMSupport, where ~ stands for the home folder</li>
<li>The Contents/PlugIns folder of the application bundle, if the application
is bundled</li>

</ul>

<h2>Mac OS X, Mach-O format</h2>

<p>Quesa plug-ins can be found in the following locations. </p>

<ul>
<li>The folder containing the application</li>
<li>The Contents/PlugIns
folder of the application bundle, if the application is bundled</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mac OS 9</h2>

<p>Quesa plug-ins can be found in the following locations. </p>

<ul>
<li>The folder containing Quesa</li>
<li>The folder containing the application</li>
<li>The Extensions folder within the System Folder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Quesa plug-ins can be found in the following locations. </p>

<ul>
<li>The directory containing the host application (typically the one containing Quesa)</li>
<li>The system directory</li>
<li>The Windows directory</li>
</ul>

<h1>Adapting Applications for the VRML Reader</h1>

<p>For the most part, you just drop in the plug-in and it works.  However, there
are a few ways in which in may be appropriate to change the host
application.</p>

<p>First, if the application allows 3DMF files to be opened using an Open dialog
or by drag and drop, it may need to be modified to recognize VRML files by the
usual <code>.wrl</code> extension.</p>

<p>Second, consider the fact that some VRML files use external texture images. 
In VRML 2, this looks something like</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
ImageTexture {
    url "skin.jpg"
}
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>while in VRML 1 it would look like:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
Texture2 {
    filename "skin.png"
}
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The image may be specified by a simple file name, as shown, or by a relative
file name or Internet URL.  The VRML plug-in does not know how to find your
files or how to read any image formats, so you need to provide a callback
function pointer.  The function pointer should have the type:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
typedef TQ3TextureObject (*LoadTexProcPtr)(
    const char* inURL,
    TQ3StorageObject inStorage );
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The application passes the texture callback to the plug-in by setting a
property on the storage object containing the VRML data:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
LoadTexProcPtr	funcPtr = TextureImportCallback;
Q3Object_SetProperty( storageObj, 'TxIm', sizeof(LoadTexProcPtr),
    &amp;funcPtr );
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>The first parameter received by the callback, <code>inURL</code>, is simply
the file name or URL specified in the VRML code, with a NUL terminator.  You
should assume that its character encoding is UTF-8, though in most cases it will
be simple ASCII.  The second parameter, the storage object, helps your callback
know where the VRML file is, and hence where the texture file should be relative
to that.  If the storage object is, say, a path storage or FSSpec storage, you
can obtain the VRML file location by simple Quesa calls.  If it is a memory
storage object, you could attach the file location to the storage as an object
property when you attach the function pointer object property.</p>

<p>Third and least important, the application can set a property of type 'Debg'
on the storage object containing the VRML data.  When the import process
finishes, this property will be replaced by a stream of text telling about what
went on, and possibly went wrong.</p>

<h1>Feedback and Bug Reporting</h1>

<p>You can ask questions about the VRML Reader on the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=45158">quesa-develop mailing
list</a>. To report a bug in the VRML reader, go to the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=45158&atid=442052">Quesa bug
tracker</a>, submit a bug, and assign it the "VRML Reader" category.  It will
usually be helpful to attach a sample file to the bug report.</p>
