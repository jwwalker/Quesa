	@function	NodeV2ToObject
	
	@abstract	Attempt to convert a VRML 2 node to a Quesa object.
	
	@discussion	The reason that the node is not passed as a const reference is
				that whenever we successfully produce a Quesa object from a
				node, we cache that object in the node.  This is not only a
				speed optimization, it is also necessary to guarantee that we
				will have multiple Quesa references whenever there are multiple
				references to a VRML node.
	
	@param		ioNode		Node to convert.
	
	@result		An object reference, or NULL on failure.
