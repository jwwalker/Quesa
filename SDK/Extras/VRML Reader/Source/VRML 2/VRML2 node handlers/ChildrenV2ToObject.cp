	@function	ChildrenV2ToObject
	
	@abstract	Look for a "children" field in the given node, and convert that
				to a Quesa DisplayGroup object.

	@discussion	The "children" field should contain either a single node or a
				bracketed array of nodes.  If it is a single node,  or if the
				array only contains one node, we will not bother to create a
				DisplayGroup, but simply return the Quesa version of the child.
	
	@param		ioNode		Node to convert.
	@param		inReader	The reader object.
	@param		outMadeGroup	Receives a flag indicating whether the operation
								made a group of more than one child.
	
	@result		An object reference, or NULL on failure.
