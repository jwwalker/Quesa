	@function	ParseVRML1
	
	@abstract	Parse VRM 1 dataL, producing an array of nodes in PolyValue
				dictionary format.
	
	@discussion	This first phase of VRML parsing does not know much about VRML
				semantics.  It does not know the differences between specific
				node types.
				
				In order to avoid backtracking, the grammar allows some things
				that are not allowed in VRML.  For instance, it allows an array
				to contain any mix of values, whereas VRML really only allows
				an array of numbers, an array of strings, or an array of nodes.

	@param		inVRMLText		The VRML input data.
	@param		outNodes		Receives an array of dictionaries.
	@param		ioDebugStream	Receives text describing the parsing process.
								You may pass NULL if you do not want this.
