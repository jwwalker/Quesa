/*  NAME:
        QGDemoInput_Win.cpp
        
    DESCRIPTION:
		Windows implementation of QGDemoInput - checks for key presses

	NOTES:
		Author	- John Klima
		uses Win32 API GetAsyncKeyState to poll the keyboard in windows
		this works just hunky for multi-key presses too, in or out 
		 of the message queue!

		//without having to poll the windows message queue.
		// i might have to use GetKeyState which returns a 256 byte array
		//of all the virtual keys, and iterate checking all low order bits.

		//the problem with this is its not asynchronous, meaning a key is removed from
		//the stack once a windows key press message has been processed.  GetAsync works
		//regardless of the state of the message queue.

		//kinda stinky but i'll look into a better way.  Ultimately, in windows
		//we would likely not be here anyway unless a key press message was sent
		//to our application and we processed it.
