/*  NAME:
        QGDemoInput.h
        
    DESCRIPTION:
		QGDemoInput - lists key constants
		also declares routine to poll for key presses - this is platform specific
		 
		This file defines a very simple, keyboard-based input hack
		to let us get up and running with some interactive Queeg demos.
		It is not meant as a proper way to do game input.
		
		revisit at a later stage and clean up/extend key definitions
	
		We define the interface here, and we'll have a separate
		.cpp file for the implementation on each platform, since
		this is a very platform-specific issue.
