There are two trimeshes, one using kQ3PixelTypeRGB16#		(opaque) and one using kQ3PixelTypeARGB16 with a transparent center.#		When viewed from the right direction, you should be able to see the#		opaque mesh through the transparent hole.##	COPYRIGHT:#		Quesa Copyright © 2007, Quesa Developers.#	#		For the list of Quesa Developers, and contact details, see:#	#			Documentation/contributors.html#	#		For the current version of Quesa, see:#	#			<http://www.quesa.org/>#	#		This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or#		modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public#		License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either#		version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.#	#		This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,#		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of#		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
