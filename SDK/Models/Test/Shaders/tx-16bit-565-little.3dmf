#	NAME:
#		tx-16bit-565-little.3dmf
#
#	DESCRIPTION:
#		Test model for a texture using kQ3PixelTypeRGB16_565 and little-endian
#		byte order.  The texture is designed to be simple but asymmetrical, so
#		that one can tell at a glance whether the colors or orientation are
#		wrong.  All the models in this family should look the same if rendered
#		correctly.
