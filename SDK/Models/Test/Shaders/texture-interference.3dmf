#    NAME:
#         texture-interference.3dmf
#
#    DESCRIPTION:
#       This test model contains a free-floating attribute set containing a
#       texture shader followed by 4 geometries, the 2nd of which has an
#       embedded texture.  The 2nd geometry should of course show its embedded
#       texture (which is just white) but the other 3 geometries should show the
#       floating texture.
#
#       At the time this model was created, the interactive renderer had a bug
#       causing the embedded texture to interfere with texturing of later
#       geometries.
