This sample program is for Mac OS X only.  It illustrates the use of Quesa as a
custom control in a compositing Carbon window.

In compositing windows (which are preferred over non-compositing windows),
controls are drawn from back to front so that controls in front can draw over
controls in back.  In can be tricky to reconcile this scheme with Quesa's
OpenGL-based renderers, which normally drawn in an OpenGL drawing surface that
is in front of the rest of the window.  This sample solves that problem by
putting the OpenGL surface behind the window, and cutting holes in the window to
let the OpenGL drawing show through.

See comments in HIQuesaView.h for more information on how to use this custom
control.
