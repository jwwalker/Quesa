 *
 *      would produce a rootGroup field of group1, a depth field of 2,
 *      positions[0] would hold the position of group2 within group1,
 *      and positions[1] would hold the position of object within group2.
 *
 *
 *      Note that the contents of the position array are only valid if
 *      the submitted groups are unchanged since they were submitted
 *      for picking.
 *
 *      If these groups have had items added or removed since they
